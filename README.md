# Jiahui Zhou
# SI508-Final project

## Please install the following libraries:
* bs4
* alternate_advanced_caching
* requests
* datetime
* json
* plotly
* plotly.plotly
* plotly.graph_objs

## Project Overview
It is a program to use data to validate an opinion "The Makeup Industry Is Now More Skin Shadeâ€“Inclusive Than Ever." I chose 
the data of historical shades set evolution of Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation, for both its largest color variations in current mainstream foundations and its constant name convention (otherwise, I am not able to scrape its previous color set on the webpage). I manually got the 5 sets of shade codes for year 2013, 2015, 2016, March 2018, and July 2018, scaped individual color hex code from its website, and use a color API to transfer the code into HSL(hue, saturation, lightness) color mode. Then I used plot.ly to visually present them. 

## Sample Output
* Image 'Shades_Distribution_of_esteelauder_doublewear_all' is the sample output of the command 'plot all'
* Image 'Shades_Distribution_of_esteelauder_doublewear_2018_7' is the sample output of the command 'plot 2018.7'

## Run Process
* Make sure you have installed all the libraries I listed above. No need to register anything including to use the color API I used in this project.
* No database-related things in this project.
* Run file 'main.py'
* Try command 'plot all' to see the shades of each publish in the last five years
* Try command 'plot <Year>'(e.g. plot 2018.7) to see the shades of publish in the specific year
* Quit input by `exit`
* Term explanation on input of `help`
  
### Final project requirements meet: 
* Three data sources used in total: color API, hex codes scraped from website, manually pullup shades changes in years
* Caching in final_proj.py, with the code of alternative_advanced_caching.py
* Process API data into a color class, saved hex codes into color class, shade changes data into a nested dictionary
* import modules bs4, datetime, plotly
* test file 'final_proj_test.py' with 3 unittest.TestSuite subclasses and 13 test methods
* Produce a product as result of a visualization
* Define 2 classes: Foundation, Color
* Sample outputs included

## File overview:
* main.py: program the interactive command lines
* final_proj.py: define Foundation class and Color class, include codes that scrapes the color hex codes, and API to change them to hsl color mode
* final_plot.py: define two functions to plot the shades set either in a single year, or plot all years in one figure
* final_proj_test.py: test file
* esteelauder_doublewear_data.py: manually pullup data for shades changes, in dictionary type
* advanced_expiry_caching.py: copy from code provided on the class. Define a chache class to store the respond to a cache file.
* page_scraped.json: cache file
* color_hsl.json: cache file
* Shades_Distribution_of_esteelauder_doublewear_all': sample output of the command 'plot all'
* Shades_Distribution_of_esteelauder_doublewear_2018_7': sample output of the command 'plot 2018.7'
* README.md
